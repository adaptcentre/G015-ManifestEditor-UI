                In order to understand the Euthalian tradition and its impact on the interpretation of the New Testament, we are currently working on multiple publications:
            </p>    
                <ul>
                    <li><p>New editions of Codex H (GA 015), including an open access online version comprised of new images, a new transcription, and an English translation (which can be found in the “edition” tab) and a printed version of these features prefaced with a review of scholarship. The editions enable us to reach back to the earliest extant layer of the Euthalian tradition.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Catalogue of Manuscripts with Euthalian features, comprising entries on every manuscript that preserves some feature associated with the Euthalian tradition. The features that make up the system are not consistently presented in the manuscripts, so this tool provides a new set of data relevant for those who work in the future to create editions of these complex paratexts, to trace the diachronic development of the tradition, or to correlate the textual and paratextual relationships between manuscripts.</p> </li>

He is the author of <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/manuscripts-of-the-book-of-revelation-9780198849056?cc=gb&lang=en&">Manuscripts of the Book of Revelation: New Philology, Paratexts, Reception</a> (Oxford University Press, 2020) and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/religion/biblical-studies-new-testament/book-revelation-and-early-jewish-textual-culture?format=HB">The Book of Revelation and Early Jewish Textual Culture </a> (Cambridge University Press, 2017), along with multiple articles, edited books, and translations. He is also the recipient of the Manfred Lautenschlaeger Award for Theological Promise (2019) and the Paul J. Achtemeier Award for New Testament Scholarship (2018). In addition to the TiNT project, he is the Principal Investigator on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIykXTuZ5nE">Paratextual Understanding project</a>, funded by the Templeton Religion Trust.
                
                                    Garrick’s work on the TiNT project revolves around the features of the Euthalian apparatus to Acts, the Pauline Epistles, and the Catholic epistles, focusing especially on the chapter lists and quotation lists in different manuscripts.

                                    Formerly a post-doctoral researcher on the TiNT project, Kimberley A. Fowler (PhD, Manchester 2013) is now Assistant Professor of New Testament at the University of Groningen. She has also held teaching and research positions in New Testament and early Christianity more broadly at Durham University (2018 - 2021) and the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (2015 - 2018). She is the author of various articles and studies on topics in the broad area of early Christianity, especially the texts from the Coptic Nag Hammadi Codices, with a focus on the production and reception context of the manuscripts and what this reveals about diverse early Christian reading practices. Her research at present continues to focus particularly on both canonical and non-canonical Christian literature, especially the paratextual features across Coptic and Greek manuscripts on both sides of the canonical boundary.
